# Changelog

All notable changes to brickwork are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
semantic versioning. Template block names, HTMX target IDs, Alpine component
names, event names and token names are treated as public API (see the spec's
versioning contract).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

Phase 0: the v1 vertical slice. Proves the substrate end-to-end (85 Python
tests + 9 axe/no-JS checks green).

- **Icon registry + `{% bw_icon %}`** (contract: token/template): a name -> SVG
  registry (the public contract) seeded from a curated Lucide subset (ISC +
  MIT-for-Feather, both in `NOTICE`). Injection-safe (name-referenced, never raw
  `|safe`), a11y-enforced (decorative XOR label, ICO-007; icon-only button
  requires an accessible name, ICO-008), loud on an unknown name (ICO-013),
  RTL-flip for directional icons (ICO-014), size tokens (ICO-004).
- **Token layer** (contract: token): DTCG source -> Style Dictionary ->
  stable-named `tokens.css` (`--bw-*` on `:root` + `[data-theme="dark"]` +
  `[data-density=*]`), a Tailwind `@theme inline` bridge, and a JS re-export.
  oklch, dark authored not derived (BR-BW-TOK-002/003), four composable axes.
- **App shell** (`shell/app.html`, `auth.html`, `centred.html`) with named
  blocks and a working no-JS floor (BR-BW-HTMX-001): no `<script>` in the bare
  shell, native `<details>` sidebar toggle + mobile drawer, a skip link, logical
  CSS properties throughout for RTL.
- **Navigation** (contract: navigation): `NavItem`/`NavContext` dataclasses (with
  `badge`, `external_url`, and a section-header variant), a `resolver_match`-based
  active-route resolver (never `path.startswith`), duplicate-key validation at
  import, host-injected permission/feature/policy visibility, and a `safe_reverse`
  that never 500s. Recursive `nav/_nav.html` via Django 6.0 `{% partialdef %}`.
- **Components**: button (icon-only a11y, loading spinner), badge, alert, page
  header, empty state (no-data/no-results), pagination, and a structure-only
  `data_table` (server-side sort, stable per-row swap ids; not virtualisation).
- **Forms + the 422 HTMX contract** (contract: interaction): an accessible field
  renderer (`aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby` on the input), and the
  `hx-target="this" hx-swap="outerHTML"` 422 validation swap, with a full-page
  no-JS fallback that is itself a working page.
- **Theme axes**: `resolve_theme_attributes` (settings defaults + a host
  `theme_resolver`, optional per-tenant logo), exercised for dark mode + density.
- **CI**: the load-bearing accessibility gate is now real (axe-core WCAG 2.2 AA
  against the rendered pages in light AND dark, plus a no-JS floor suite and a
  keyboard check), and the frontend build gate rebuilds + verifies the artefacts.

### Notes
- Flat `BRICKWORK_DEFAULT_*` settings (theme/density/dir + `NAV_FALLBACK`),
  default theme `light`.
- Interaction primitives (modal, toast, dropdown, combobox) are intentionally
  NOT in this slice; they are consentics-only and land later, tagged
  `[v1-single-consumer]`.

### Changed
- Scaffold reconciliation: `saas_ui` -> `brickwork` throughout (app config, template
  and static paths), and the settings shape moved from a nested `BRICKWORK` dict
  to the flat `BRICKWORK_DEFAULT_*` documented in the spec.
